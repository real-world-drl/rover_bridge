"""rover_bridge — OmniVLA inference bridge for the RoverLink differential rover.

Mirrors the ROS↔MQTT bridge (``../../ros_ws``) but talks to the RoverLink
firmware (``../RoverLink``) over its native binary contract instead of ROS:
cmd_vel goes out over UART or MQTT as a packed ``ugv_cmd_vel_t``, telemetry
comes back the same way, and the OmniVLA inference loop (camera frames out,
``omnivla/act`` + ``omnivla/ctrl`` in) runs over MQTT exactly as before.
